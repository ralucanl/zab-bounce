      <h2>Zaboca Privacy policy</h2>
       <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
       <h3>1. We collect your information via several means including:</h3>
       </blockquote>
       
       <h3>a. Registration</h3>
       <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
       <p>When you create an account with us, you provide us with information (including your name, email address, and password) that we use to offer you a personalized, relevant experience on Zaboca.</p>
       <p>To create an account on Zaboca, you must provide us with at least your name, email address, and a password. You can choose to provide further information about yourself during the registration process (for example, your gender and location). We can use this additional information to provide you with more customized services like language-specific profile pages, updates, and content, more relevant ads, and more valuable career opportunities, and it may appear on your Zaboca profile that is viewable by others. You understand that, by creating an account, Zaboca and others will be able to identify you by your Zaboca profile, and you allow Zaboca to use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our End User Agreement. We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase certain Zaboca services/items. </p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>b. Profile Information</h3>
        <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
        <p>You can add various professional and non-professional details to your profile. </p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>c. Address Book, Zaboca Contacts, and Other Services That Sync with Zaboca</h3>
        <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
        <p>We may collect information when you sync non-Zaboca content, like your email address book, mobile device contacts, or calendar - with your account. We use this information to improve your experience and allow you and your network to be better connected. You can remove your address book and any other synced information whenever you'd like. </p>
        <p>You may use the Zaboca contacts importer to upload individual contacts or your entire address book into Zaboca. Zaboca stores this information and uses it to help you manage it with "Zaboca Contacts," which can be your primary resource for storing, organizing, and utilizing your contact information. We may also use this information to enhance your Zaboca experience by helping you to grow your network by: identifying your contacts already on Zaboca; providing a template to send invitations to your contacts that have not registered with Zaboca; and suggesting people you may know but who may not be in your Zaboca Contacts. Zaboca may also use this information to show you and other Zaboca Users that you share the same uploaded contacts who may or may not be Zaboca Users. Please note that when you send an invitation to bounce another individual or organization, that person will have access to your email address because it is displayed in the invitation. Zaboca will also remind you of pending invitations. Your Zaboca connections may also have access to your email address.</p>
        <p>Zaboca makes other tools available to sync information with Zaboca, and may also develop additional features that allow Users to use their Zaboca account in conjunction with other third-party services. </p>
        <p>Another example are software tools that allow you to see Zaboca and other public social media information about the people you email and leverage Zaboca to help you gain insights from and grow your network. If you grant these products (mobile applications or other Zaboca applications that sync external email services) permission to access your email accounts, they will access your email header information in order to match it to Zaboca and other public social media profiles. Zaboca's products that sync with external email services may also temporarily cache message content for performance reasons; however, the cached message content will be temporarily cached in a way that is unreadable by Zaboca and its service providers.</p>
        <p> Any information that you upload or sync with Zaboca is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. You can remove your information at your convenience using the features Zaboca makes available as mentioned in this agreement. You can remove your address book and any other synced information at any time.</p>

        <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
        <p>We use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile device identifiers, to help us to recognize you, show you relevant ads, improve your Zaboca experience, increase security, measure use of our Services, and serve advertising.

         <p>We may target ads to Users both on and off Zaboca through a variety of ad networks and ad exchanges, using:</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>a)Advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers as permitted by mobile platforms both on and off Zaboca;</li>
			<li>b) User-provided profile information and categories;</li>
			<li>c) Information inferred from a User's profile (for example, using job titles to infer age, industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; or names to infer gender);</li>
			<li>d) Your use of Zaboca (for example, your Zaboca search history) or clicking on a Zaboca ad;</li>
			<li>e) Information from advertising partners which we use to help deliver ads more relevant to you.</li>
			<li>f) We do not share personally identifiable information with any third-party advertiser or ad network, although your profile is visible to other Zaboca Users and through public search depending on your settings.</li>
			<li>g) Zaboca may show you sponsored content in your Updates, which will be designated as sponsored content and will behave like other updates. If you take social action (for example, if you "like" or "comment" on the sponsored content), your action will be seen by your network and other Zaboca Users who are shown the sponsored content after you have acted on it.</li>

          <p>We may collect information from the devices and networks that you use to access Zaboca. This information helps us improve and secure our Services.</p>
          <p>When you visit or leave Zaboca by clicking a hyperlink or view a plugin on a third-party site, we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page that you are on when you click an ad on Zaboca. We can also receive the internet protocol ("IP") address of your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer operating system details, your type of web browser, your mobile device (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing Zaboca using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information (for example, weather information) on our mobile application.</p>

          <p>We are always seeking to improve the services we offer you and we may introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information.  Moreover, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.</p>

          <p>The personal information you provide to us may reveal or allow others to identify aspects of your life that are not expressly stated on your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender). By providing personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of Zaboca's End User Licence Agreement and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying information to us, including any information deemed "sensitive" by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part.

          <p>With certain communications you send on Zaboca, the recipient can see your name, email address, and some network information.</p>
          <p>Many communications that you initiate through Zaboca (for example, an invitation sent to a non-User) will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your network).

          <h3>11. Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
          <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
          <ul>
          	<li>a) Any information you put on your profile and any content you post on Zaboca may be seen by others. We don't provide any of your non-public information (like your email address) to third parties without your consent, unless required by law, or as described in this Policy. Other people may find your Zaboca profile information through search engines (you can choose which parts of your public profile are accessible to public search engines in your settings), or use services like Twitter or Facebook in conjunction with your Zaboca account.</li>
			<li>b) Unless you delete it, your profile on Zaboca is always viewable on the Zaboca Services. However, third-party search engines may not automatically update their caches, which may contain old public profile information.</li>
			<li>c) We do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on Zaboca, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other Zaboca services, such as Groups and Company Pages, without your consent or to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) unless Zaboca has a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy or our End User Licence Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to User service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of Zaboca, our Users, or the public.</li> 
			<li>d) Content distributed through Zaboca's sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of Zaboca. For example, when you post content, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results. Also, for example if you have bound your Zaboca account to your Twitter account, you can easily share content from Zaboca to Twitter. </li>
			<li>e) Third parties (for example, your email provider) may give you the option to upload certain information in your Zaboca contacts onto their own service. If you choose to share your Zaboca contacts, you will be granting your third party provider the right to store, access, disclose and use your Zaboca contacts in the ways described in such third party's terms and privacy policy.</li>

          <h3>12. Developers Using Zaboca Platform Services</h3>
          <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
        	  <p>We may work with developers to build Platform Applications using Zaboca's developer tools. Whether you use Platform Applications is up to you. If you have given a Platform Application access to your Zaboca account, you can revoke that permission anytime. Also, you can opt out of providing information to developers through your connections.</p>
				<p>We may collaborate with and allow third parties to use Zaboca's developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with Zaboca. These third-party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use Zaboca platform technology or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications ("Platform Applications"). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to Zaboca. If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information about you, just as your connections do. You may opt out of providing information to third-party developers through your connections by accessing the "Turn on/off data sharing with third-party applications" control.</p>

         	<p> We conduct our own surveys and polls and also help third parties do this type of research. Your participation in surveys or polls is up to you. You may also opt out of getting invitations to participate in surveys.</p>
			<p>Polls and Surveys may be conducted by Zaboca, Users, or third parties. Some third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll. Zaboca or third parties may follow up with you regarding your participation. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it. You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing your settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.</p>
